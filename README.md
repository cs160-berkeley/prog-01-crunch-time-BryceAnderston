# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Crunch Time is an app that allows the user to check how many calories a number of repetitions (or minutes, if more appropriate) of an exercise will burn (or alternatively, how much of a particular exercise is needed to burn a target number of calories), and/or to compare two exercises together.
